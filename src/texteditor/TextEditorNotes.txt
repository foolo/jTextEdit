Bugs/problems:
- Shift+home/end selection disappears
- If middle mouse button is clicked on the empty area beside the tabs, the current tab is closed anyway.

# Features:
- In-program feature request
- Show line number
- Show encoding
- Show file path (for example in parenthesis after the filename as in gedit)
- Open recent files
- Instead of showing "Can not reload new file", the menu option "Reload file with different encoding..." should be disabled.
